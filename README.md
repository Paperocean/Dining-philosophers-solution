This C++ code implements a simulation of the dining philosophers problem using threads and synchronization mechanisms. 
The dining philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that illustrates the challenges of avoiding deadlock and contention in a multi-process system.
While using locks for individual forks might resolve the issue, I find it satisfactory that implementing locks for both forks simultaneously seems to be sufficient to mitigate the problem.
